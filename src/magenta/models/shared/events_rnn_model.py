    """Generates an event sequence using beam search.

    Initially, the beam is filled with `beam_size` copies of the initial event
    sequence.

    Each iteration, the beam is pruned to contain only the `beam_size` event
    sequences with highest likelihood. Then `branch_factor` new event sequences
    are generated for each sequence in the beam. These new sequences are formed
    by extending each sequence in the beam by `steps_per_iteration` steps. So
    between a branching and a pruning phase, there will be `beam_size` *
    `branch_factor` active event sequences.

    Prior to the first "real" iteration, an initial branch generation will take
    place. This is for two reasons:

    1) The RNN model needs to be "primed" with the initial event sequence.
    2) The desired total number of steps `num_steps` might not be a multiple of
       `steps_per_iteration`, so the initial branching generates steps such that
       all subsequent iterations can generate `steps_per_iteration` steps.

    After the final iteration, the single event sequence in the beam with
    highest likelihood will be returned.

    Args:
      events: The initial event sequence, a Python list-like object.
      num_steps: The integer length in steps of the final event sequence, after

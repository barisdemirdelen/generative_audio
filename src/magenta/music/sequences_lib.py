  """Infers chords for a NoteSequence and adds them as TextAnnotations.

  For each set of simultaneously-active notes in a NoteSequence (optionally for
  only one instrument), infers a chord symbol and adds it to NoteSequence as a
  TextAnnotation. Every change in the set of active notes will result in a new
  chord symbol unless the new set is smaller than `min_notes_per_chord`.

  If `sequence` is quantized, simultaneity will be determined by quantized steps
  instead of time.

  Args:
    sequence: The NoteSequence for which chords will be inferred. Will be
        modified in place.
    instrument: The instrument number whose notes will be used for chord
        inference. If None, all instruments will be used.
    min_notes_per_chord: The minimum number of simultaneous notes for which to
        infer a chord.

  Raises:
    ChordSymbolException: If a chord cannot be determined for a set of
    simultaneous notes in `sequence`.
